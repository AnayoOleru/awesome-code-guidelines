# Code Performance
We need to be observing things that can possibly make a program slow or perform sub-optimally in production. Things to watch out for include the following:

- **Complexity** - Watch out for nested for loops. Itâ€™s not always a bad thing but see if there are ways to refactor code like this to be less complex. Always look for ways to optimize the running time of your code. 

- **Efficiency** - Encourage the use of better data structures or faster algorithms to solve problems. A typical example of this would be using a dictionary for grouped data instead of using multiple lists or declaring unnecessary variables.

- **Memory management** - Instill a mindset to always think about ways to optimize memory usage in your code. An Android Developer for instance should be encouraged as much as possible to ensure to cleanup afterwards to ensure there are no unused variables and memory leaks.

- **Design Patterns** - Design patterns besides being accepted ways of solving repetitive problems can also lead to more efficient programs in terms of time and space. Wherever applicable, ensure you are applying design patterns to solve general repetitive problems.
