# General best practices
Writing code to follow best practices is at the heart of good coding practice. Highlighted below are a few of the things you would need to look out for when reviewing code.

- **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**
Code should be DRY. Just like earlier mentioned, you need to ask the question “Is there redundant or duplicate code?”. Ensure that unnecessary repetitions don’t exist within the code base.

- **Object Oriented Programming**
Follow [SOLID principles](http://code.tutsplus.com/series/the-solid-principles--cms-634) for writing object oriented programs. At the very least, we should ensure that programs have high cohesion and loose coupling.

- **Documenting Code**
Code is expected to be thoroughly documented. Always use doc style comments if possible but also write code in a way that you may require little or no comments.

- **Separation of Concerns**
Technically, you could write an entire application code within a single file. But that would prove to be a nightmare to read and maintain. Ensure that your code is always broken into logical containers, properly arranged within folders. This makes it far easier to navigate through your codebase.
